PROS OF TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
  - Creates a history of work
  - Creates large body of tests that can be used later for regression
  - Easy to tell if functionality of a module remains
  - Encourages code modularity (giant blocks of code are harder to test)
  - Easier to tell what each function is supposed to do

CONS OF TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
  - Tests must be reviewed regularly. Not only for relevance but also for performance impacts on submissions (this might only be an issue for larger projects)
  - Adds overhead to development (though I'd say it's probably bad to consider making tests overhead)
  - Tests might not be easy to make
    - Especially so for complex functions, poor initial planning of these would cause tests written for them to be useless (if things shift)
  - To learn it you might have to spend 9 hours doing a github tutorial (I will admit maybe I wasn't entirely on task the entire time though)
